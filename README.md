## Overview

Movie Data Analysis is a project that aims to analyze movie data from different sources and extract useful information and insights. By combining data from various datasets, this project provides a comprehensive analysis of the movie industry, including trends, popular genres, and key players such as directors and actors.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies and tools were used in this project:

- Python: The project is implemented using the Python programming language, which is widely used for data analysis and manipulation.
- Pandas: Pandas is a powerful data analysis library in Python, used for handling and processing structured data.
- NumPy: NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, used for numerical operations on large arrays and matrices.
- TMDb API: The TMDb API (The Movie Database API) is used to extract additional movie data, such as movie ratings, release dates, and cast/crew information.
- Wikipedia: Wikipedia is used as a source to extract movie data, including director names, actor names, genres, and movie titles.
- Jupyter Notebook: The project is implemented using Jupyter Notebook, an interactive coding environment that allows for easy prototyping and data exploration.
- NLTK: The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a library used for natural language processing tasks, including sentiment analysis.

## Summary

The Movie Data Analysis project focuses on analyzing movie data to gain insights into the movie industry. The project performs the following tasks:

1. Importing Packages: The necessary Python packages such as Pandas, NumPy, TMDb API, and NLTK are imported to handle data, perform various operations, and conduct sentiment analysis.

2. Uploading Data: Two datasets are used in this project: the Movie Data Set (till 2016) and data related to movie credits. These datasets are uploaded and used for analysis.

3. Visualizing Year-wise Count: The project includes a visualization of the year-wise count of movies, providing an overview of the movie production trend over the years.

4. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Data cleaning and preprocessing steps are performed to handle missing values, format columns, and clean movie titles for further analysis.

5. Extracting Features from Kaggle Data: Relevant features, such as director names, actor names, genres, and movie titles, are extracted from the Kaggle dataset.

6. Extracting Features of 2018 and 2019 Movies from Wikipedia: Features of movies released in 2018 and 2019 are extracted from Wikipedia, including director names, actor names, genres, and movie titles.

7. Combining Datasets: All the extracted features from different sources are combined into a single dataframe for a comprehensive analysis.

8. Extracting Features of 2020 Movies from Wikipedia: Features of movies released in 2020 are extracted from Wikipedia, including movie titles and cast/crew information.

9. Sentiment Analysis: The project includes sentiment analysis of movie reviews using the NLTK library, which provides insights into the overall sentiment of the audience towards specific movies.

The Movie Data Analysis project provides a valuable resource for exploring movie trends, analyzing genres, identifying influential directors and actors, and conducting sentiment analysis. It can be used to gain insights into the movie industry, make data-driven decisions, and perform further analysis based on the extracted features.

## Results
